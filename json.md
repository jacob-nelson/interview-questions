###What is JSON?

Answer: JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data format for human-readable exchange of information between systems.
What are the data types supported by JSON?

Answer: JSON supports strings, numbers, booleans, null values, and arrays of these types. It doesn't directly support complex data structures like objects found in programming languages.
What are the key characteristics of JSON?

Answer: Key characteristics include:
Readable by humans
Lightweight and easy to parse
Language-independent
Supports a variety of data types
What is the difference between JSON and XML?

Answer: Both are data formats for information exchange, but:
JSON is simpler and less verbose than XML.
JSON is typeless, while XML has defined data types.
JSON uses curly braces and square brackets for structure, while XML uses tags.
Intermediate Understanding:

Explain the concept of JSON objects in JSON data.

Answer: JSON objects are collections of key-value pairs, similar to objects in programming languages. Keys are strings, and values can be any valid JSON data type.
How do you parse JSON data in a programming language?

Answer: Most languages provide libraries or built-in functions for parsing JSON. These functions convert the JSON string into a native data structure (e.g., object in JavaScript).
What are some advantages of using JSON?

Answer: Advantages include:
Simplicity and ease of use
Lightweight and efficient data transfer
Language-independence
Wide support in programming languages and APIs
What are some limitations of JSON?

Answer: Limitations include:
Lack of complex data structures like inheritance
No built-in support for date and time formats
Advanced Understanding:

How can you validate the integrity of JSON data?

Answer: You can use JSON schema, a validation framework that defines the expected structure and data types for valid JSON data.
Explain how JSON can be used in web APIs?

Answer: JSON is a popular format for data exchange in web APIs. APIs can return data in JSON format, and clients can send data to APIs using JSON.
Describe scenarios where JSON might not be the best choice for data exchange.

Answer: While JSON is widely used, it might not be ideal for very complex data structures or situations requiring strict data validation. XML or Protocol Buffers might be better suited in such cases.
What are some security considerations when working with JSON data?

Answer: Be cautious of potential security vulnerabilities like:
XSS (Cross-Site Scripting): Sanitize user-provided data before including it in JSON to prevent injection of malicious scripts.
Injection Attacks: Validate JSON data to prevent injection of SQL or other code.
