### What is React?

React is a front-end and open-source JavaScript library which is useful in developing user interfaces specifically for applications with a single page. It is helpful in building complex and reusable user interface(UI) components of mobile and web applications as it follows the component-based approach.

The important features of React are:

- It supports server-side rendering.
- It will make use of the virtual DOM rather than real DOM (Data Object Model) as RealDOM manipulations are expensive.
- It follows unidirectional data binding or data flow.
- It uses reusable or composable UI components for developing the view.

### What are the advantages of using React?

MVC is generally abbreviated as Model View Controller.

➢ **Use of Virtual DOM to improve efficiency:** React uses virtual DOM to render the view. As the name suggests, virtual DOM is a virtual representation of the real DOM. Each time the data changes in a react app, a new virtual DOM gets created. Creating a virtual DOM is much faster than rendering the UI inside the browser. Therefore, with the use of virtual DOM, the efficiency of the app improves.  
➢ **Gentle learning curve:** React has a gentle learning curve when compared to frameworks like Angular. Anyone with little knowledge of javascript can start building web applications using React.  
➢ **SEO friendly:** React allows developers to develop engaging user interfaces that can be easily navigated in various search engines. It also allows server-side rendering, which boosts the SEO of an app.  
➢ **Reusable components:** React uses component-based architecture for developing applications. Components are independent and reusable bits of code. These components can be shared across various applications having similar functionality. The re-use of components increases the pace of development.  
➢ **Huge ecosystem of libraries to choose from:** React provides you with the freedom to choose the tools, libraries, and architecture for developing an application based on your requirement.

### What are the limitations of React?

The few limitations of React are as given below:

- React is not a full-blown framework as it is only a library.
- The components of React are numerous and will take time to fully grasp the benefits of all.
- It might be difficult for beginner programmers to understand React.
- Coding might become complex as it will make use of inline templating and JSX.
